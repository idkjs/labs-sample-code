# Sample code

This repository contains sample applications inspired by the [quick start guides](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/labs/filtered-stream/quick-start). The scripts included in this folder allow you to:

1. Obtain a Bearer token
1. Get a list of filters currently set on your stream
1. Delete all the filters currently on your stream
1. Setup a set of example filters to your stream
1. Connect to the stream, and handle potential disconnections

`filtered_stream.js`, `filtered_stream.py` and `filtered_stream.rb` allow you to run the above flow in JavaScript, Python and Ruby for [Filtered Stream](https://twittercommunity.com/t/new-filtered-stream-endpoints-available-in-labs-and-the-future-of-statuses-filter/129888).

## Authentication

In order to successfully run the scripts, you must add your Twitter application credentials at the top of each file, where indicated. Remember to remove these credentials when done.
